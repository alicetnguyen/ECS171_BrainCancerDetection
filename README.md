# Brain Cancer Detection Website

A full-stack web application that classifies brain MRI scans into four categories‚Äî**glioma**, **meningioma**, **pituitary tumor**, or **no tumor**‚Äîusing a combined CNN + handcrafted‚Äêfeature model served by Flask, with a React frontend for upload and visualization.

---

## Features

- **Upload MRI scans** (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`) via a clean React interface     
- **Output card** displaying the scan preview, predicted label, and confidence  
- **Animated gradient** background and polished, responsive layout  
- **Flask API** (Python) for model inference

## üìÅ Repository Structure
- **How to run the localhost**: What you are going to want to do is go to the folder directory of `python_backend` and `frontend` and within these files directories, what you are going to want to do is open a new terminal
   - Within this terminal (in the frontend directory) you are going to run 'npm install' and then run 'npm start'
 
   - Within the 'python_backend' terminal, you are going to run 'python app.py'
 
- Once these are both up and running on your localhost port 3000 for react and port 5001 for Flask, you are ready to use the demo website!
